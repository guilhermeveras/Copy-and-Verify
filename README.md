# Copy-and-Verify
A single‑file PowerShell utility that flattens a directory tree, copying every file it finds into one destination folder while keeping the originals intact. During the run it shows a live progress bar, predicts how long the transfer will take, adds numeric suffixes to avoid name collisions, and validates integrity by comparing SHA‑256 hashes.
